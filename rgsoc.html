Especially Sven Fuchs and Anika Lindtner helped run and manage the initiative over the summer. Our goal is to make sure this to was only the first year of many more for a Rails Girls summer of Code to come.

Modelled after Google Summer of Code, but with a focus on beginners and women wanting  to go into programming full-time. The initiative aims to get women involved in Open Source. It is the first ever event of its kind in the world. It began 1st of July, 2013, and ran for three months. <a href="http://railsgirlssummerofcode.org/blog">Read the blog &rarr;</a>
