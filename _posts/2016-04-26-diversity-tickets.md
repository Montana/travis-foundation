Organising a conference is difficult. First and foremost, there are the logistics of putting a team together, finding a location, and getting the financial support. Then there’s the issue of the talks — making a speaker line-up as diverse as possible while also offering a wide range of interesting talk topics — and of making sure that the event is as inclusive as possible, by offering a code of conduct, a way to enforce it, and thinking of the many little details which turn a good conference into a great one.

Offering diversity tickets — dedicated free tickets for people from underrepresented groups in tech — is one of those details which, for many conferences that have introduced them into their concept (OTSConf, [kod.io](http://linz.kod.io/), Concat(), CSSConf EU to name a few), has proven to mean so much to the attendees and to the conference itself.  
Reaching your audience as a conference organiser is just as much work as looking for speakers — it takes time and effort, but it is infinitely rewarding. Similarly to a Code of Conduct, diversity tickets show that conference organisers really care about their audience and think ahead for their attendees. Furthermore, supporting attendees who would not be able to attend the conference otherwise, or who would not fall under the category of “usual” conference attendees, also sends an amazing message to the world: You belong here, too. After all, what is the purpose of an inclusive conference if the audience is made up of very similar members?

With years of expertise in the field of conferences and of diversity in Open Source and tech, Travis Foundation has been offering diversity consultancy to conference organisers, to support them in making their conference more inclusive, one change at a time. This consultancy also includes helping organisers with the extra load of work that comes with offering diversity tickets, using our very own app. We have partnered with [RubyMonstas](http://rubymonstas.org/), a Rails Girls study group based in Berlin, to create a platform that would allow conference organisers to quickly and easily set up a diversity ticket system for their conference: meet [diversitytickets.org](https://diversitytickets.org)!

The concept is simple: Organisers can add their conference to the platform and outline how many diversity tickets they’re offering; this also includes information regarding the offer of travel grants or accommodation support. As soon as we start working together with the conference, it’s visible in our overview and applicants can apply for a diversity ticket through our system. We handle the applications and selection process, which includes a triaging of the applications, an unbiased raffled out selection and the communication with the applicants; we can also handle travel grants if needed. In this way, we hope to reduce the workload for conference organisers around the world, so they can concentrate on other tasks. With a centralised place for diversity ticket applications, applicants can also find conferences they would not have otherwise known about, using the app as a “hub” to find interesting new inclusive conferences to attend.

**Unbiased selection processes**

We have thought about and experimented with different ways to select “the best” diversity tickets holders, for example through a jury process. A jury seems like the most obvious solution for many, however jury selection is based on meritocracy, which is a system and ideology we wish to step away from, and it also introduces bias, no matter how hard we try to select applications objectively. On top of that, we want our diversity ticket application questions to be as unobtrusive as possible; for this reason, we’ve realised that raffling out the tickets after removing fake or non-serious applications has produced the most fair results.
This is the process we found works best and in the least intrusive way for diversity ticket applicants.  

**Get in touch!** 

While the app is currently only used specifically for conferences interested in working together with us, in the near future it’s going to give all conferences the possibility to use diversitytickets.org to advertise their diversity tickets, so that applicants can get informed about the conferences that offer special tickets or grants.
