    What is this?
  </h2>
  <a></a>
  <article>
    <p>
      Travis Foundation is a work-in-progress non-profit initiative aiming
      to give back and pay forward to the Open Source community.
    </p>
    <p>
      <a href="http://travis-ci.org">Travis CI</a> has always been very much
      rooted in Open Source. Working <i>with</i> the community to build a service
      <i>for</i> the community has been one wild love and succes story. Since
      <a href="http://travis-ci.org">Travis CI</a> now is an established, solid
      service, it is time to give back even more.
    </p>
    <p>
      With Travis Foundation we will use our expertise to support projects that
      provide opportunities to newcomers, foster diversity and make the
      community an even greater place in general.
