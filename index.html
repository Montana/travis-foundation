        <P>We are currently talking to people, collecting and discussing ideas. If you're interested to come on board - get in touch! </P>

        <P>The primary reason for us to support this project is that we want to give something back to the  community which helped us so much since we started. Without the  great help and feedback from developers from all around Europe PAYMILL would not be where it is  today. </P>

    What is this?
  </h2>
  <a></a>
  <article>
    <p>
      Travis Foundation is a work-in-progress non-profit initiative aiming
      to give back and pay forward to the Open Source community.
    </p>
    <p>
      <a href="http://travis-ci.org">Travis CI</a> has always been very much
      rooted in Open Source. Working <i>with</i> the community to build a service
      <i>for</i> the community has been one wild love and succes story. Since
      <a href="http://travis-ci.org">Travis CI</a> now is an established, solid
      service, it is time to give back even more.
    </p>
    <p>
      With Travis Foundation we will use our expertise to support projects that
      provide opportunities to newcomers, foster diversity and make the
      community an even greater place in general.
